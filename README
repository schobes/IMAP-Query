NAME
    IMAP::Query - Build IMAP search queries!

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    This module is for those of us that can't create Polish notation queries
    by hand, IMAP::Query can help you create them using a syntax inspired by
    other query builder modules such as SQL::Abstract.

        use IMAP::Query qw(build_search_string);

        my $query = build_search_string(
            BEFORE => strftime('%d-%b-%Y', localtime(parsedate('yesterday'))),
            NOT    => 'DELETED',
            -or    => [
                FROM => 'test@example.com',
                -and => [
                    FROM    => 'other@example.com',
                    SUBJECT => 'TESTING',
                ],
            ],
        );

        ... # Do something interesting with our $query

  build_search_string()
    This method can be exported via your use statement.

    It takes two arguments.
